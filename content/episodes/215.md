Itâ€™s Monday and Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, is back to talk about some current events and some giant spiders.

In this week's chapter, Harry and Ron follow Hagrid's advice to follow the spiders. This brings them into the Forbidden Forest, where they encounter an old friend and a new threat, uncovering some information about when the Chamber was opened last.
