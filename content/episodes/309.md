It's Monday, which means a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, Cedric Diggory's favorite Harry Potter re-read podcast!

Picking up after Sirius Black attempted to break into the Gryffindor common room, the students are moved into the Great Hall for the night, where Harry overhears an interesting conversation. The next day, Lupin is out sick and Snape subs in for him, abusing students along the way. Gryffindor and Hufflepuff face off in a Quidditch match with disastrous results, and a beloved companion leaves us forever.
