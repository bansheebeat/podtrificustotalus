Another Monday, another episode of Podtrificus Totalus, the best Harry Potter podcast in the known galaxy!

This week, we cover chapter seven of *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, which puzzles us with Shrinking Solutions and Boggarts. We face each of our worst fears to give you plenty of background knowledge, analysis, and discussion of the chapter.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:
