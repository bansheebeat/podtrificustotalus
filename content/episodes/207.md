episodeSubtitle: "'It's about the most insulting thing he could think of,' gasped Ron, coming back up. 'Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born--you know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards--like Malfoy's family--who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pure-blood.'"

This week on Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book, Cassie and Joe talk about racial allegory and The Voice for chapter seven of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, "Mudbloods and Murmurs."

Oliver Wood wakes Harry up early for Quidditch practice, but they find that the Slytherins also have a claim on the Quidditch pitch. The team gets into a scrap that ends with Malfoy calling Hermione a Mudblood and Ron burping up slugs. Later, Harry serves his detention with Gilderoy and hears a mysterious voice.
