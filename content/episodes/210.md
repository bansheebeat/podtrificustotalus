This week on Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book, Cassie and Joe stay on topic for their Shakira podcast by discussing Quidditch, broken arms, and the Wagga Wagga Werewolf.

Picking up from the previous chapter, Hermione cons Lockheart into signing a note that allows her to get a book out of the Restricted Section of the library. While the trio makes plans to brew the Polyjuice Potion, Harry is harassed by a bludger in his Quidditch match against Slytherin and lands in the Hospital Wing regrowing bones. There, he has an interesting visitor.
