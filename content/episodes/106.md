It's Monday and that means we have a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book.

This week's episode covers chapter six of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, "The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters." Harry travels to King's Cross station where he meets the Weasleys and befriends their youngest son, Ron, aboard the Hogwarts Express. On the train ride, we're introduced to a heap of new characters, including Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy, among others.

We make a number of references to outside sources and pop culture in this episode, which are listed below:

- *Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter* by Galadriel Waters (Ed. Astre Mithrandir; Published by Wizarding World Press in 2003)

- [Some Random Facts About The Weasley Family](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126084306/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=7) from J.K. Rowling's Official Site

- [NPR Radio interview with J.K. Rowling](http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-pressclubtransc.htm) (Sean Bullard; 20 October 1999)

- *Fahrenheit 451* by Ray Bradbury

- [My New School](https://harryandthepotters.bandcamp.com/track/my-new-school) by Harry and the Potters

Our spell of the week for this episode is Colovaria, which Ron tries (and fails) to use aboard the Hogwarts Express.

Thanks for listening and we’ll see you again for 1.07, “The Sorting Hat!” Have a magical day!
