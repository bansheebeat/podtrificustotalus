Welcome to the first episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a *Harry Potter* read along podcast!

We begin the episode by introducing our hosts, Cassie and Joe, and discussing our intentions for the podcast — to read the *Harry Potter* series book by book, chapter by chapter, and share our love for the series with each other and our audience. We hope that our listeners will (at best) read along with us or at least share in the experience of this awesome series, regardless of whether you’re a new or old reader.

We then enter into our discussion of the first chapter in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone*, “The Boy Who Lived.” Sources consulted outside of the chapter are listed below.
