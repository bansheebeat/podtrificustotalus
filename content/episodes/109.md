That's right — Podtrificus Totalus is back! After a long interlude, Cassie and Joe pick up once again to do a Harry Potter podcast, chapter by chapter, book by book.

This week's episode covers chapter nine of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, "The Midnight Duel." Harry's conflict with Draco Malfoy reaches new heights during flying lessons when Draco snatches Neville's Remembrall. Draco challenges Harry to a duel at night, and Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville are left to discover the mystery of the forbidden third floor corridor.
