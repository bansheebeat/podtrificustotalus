It's Monday, and this week we have a super exciting new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book. In this episode, we are joined by our first guest: Zoë from the Tea & Strumpets podcast. We had an amazing chat with Zoë about her history with the Harry Potter series, but if you want to jump straight to the chapter discussion, fast forward in your podcast app to the 24 minute mark. 

This chapter sees Harry and Ron stranded at King's Cross station. The barrier to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters has mysteriously closed, and the two friends must find their own way to Hogwarts -- which ends in disaster and adventure.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:

- *The Name of the Wind* by Patrick Rothfuss

- *Hamilton*, a musical by Lin Manuel Miranda

- [Dr. Filibuster’s Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks](https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/dr-filibusters-fabulous-wet-start-no-heat-fireworks/) on the Harry Potter Lexicon

- Filibuster in the *Oxford English Dictionary*

- *George of the Jungle* (1997)

- [Apparition](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Apparition) on the Harry Potter Wiki

Our Spell of the Week is Apparition, which adult wizards use to get around instead of flying cars.

You can hear more from Zoë on the [Tea & Strumpets podcast](https://www.romancepod.com/), which covers Regency romance novels from a modern perspective.
