It's Monday, and that means a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book.

This episode continues our coverage of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*. In the second chapter, we meet Dobby the House Elf, who reveals a dangerous plot at Hogwarts that he'll do anything to keep Harry away from -- including spelling out trouble with the Dursleys.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:

- Dobby's birthday is June 28th, according to [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/747927607409270784?lang=en)

- Hobgoblin and dobby in *Oxford English Dictionary*

- [Dobby](https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/dobby/) on the Harry Potter Lexicon

- *Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter* by Galadriel Waters (Ed. Astre Mithrandir; Published by Wizarding World Press in 2003) 

- *Avatar: The Last Airbender*

- [Mafalda Hopkirk](ttps://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Mafalda_Hopkirk) on the Harry Potter Wiki

- The [Hover Charm](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hover_Charm) on the Harry Potter Wiki

Our Spell of the Week for this episode is the Hover Charm, which Dobby uses to levitate Petunia's pudding and land Harry in a heap of trouble with the Dursleys.
