It's Monday, which is the perfect day for Podtrificus Totalus to finish off *Chamber of Secrets*! This episode is a family affair, too; we are joined by Cassie's sister Becca as a guest and we answer an email from their other sibling, Den.

In this chapter, Harry, Ron, Ginny, Gilderoy, and Fawkes leave the Chamber and head to Dumbledore's office. There, Harry reveals all the weird goings-ons at Hogwarts this year and how he was able to defeat Tom Riddle. Dumbledore and Harry discuss how our choices define us and why Harry is a true Gryffindor. Harry frees Dobby from Lucius Malfoy with his slimy sock and all the Petrified students are given the Mandrake draught.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:

- *Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter* by Galadriel Waters (Ed. Astre Mithrandir; Published by Wizarding World Press in 2003)

- [Albania](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Albania) on the Harry Potter Wiki

- The [Mandrake Draught](https://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/mandrake-draught/) on the Harry Potter Lexicon

- [Penelope Clearwater](https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/penelope-clearwater/) on the Harry Potter Lexicon

- The [Sorting Hat](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Sorting_Hat) on the Harry Potter Wiki

Our Spell of the Week for this chapter is actually a Hat of the Week. Joe tells us about the origins of the Sorting Hat and all its unique powers.

Lastly, we answer an email from Den about the queer-coding of Lockhart and how Rowling repeatedly others the Defense Against the Dark Arts professors.
