episodeSubtitle: "Don't expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have heard when the Dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them — gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks."

It's Monday, and Podtrificus Totalus is hitting you with yet another episode of the Wizarding World's favorite Harry Potter podcast!

This chapter sees Harry and Ron continue their grudge match with Hermione despite Hagrid's urgings to make up. Harry chooses to go to Hogsmeade yet again, but when the Invisibility Cloak slips off, Malfoy spots him and runs off to tell Professor Snape. Once apprehended by the Potions master, Harry learns more about his father's history with Snape and why Professor Snape dislikes him so...
