We're back with another episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a *Harry Potter* read along podcast!

With introductions out of the way, we break right into the second chapter of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, "The Vanishing Glass." The chapter turns out to be a real bummer, but at least Harry got a lemon ice pop along the way. The only outside source we reference this time around is (very briefly) Charles Dickens' Great Expectations.

Thanks for listening, and we'll see you again for 1.03, "The Letters From No One!"
