This week on Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book, Joe and Cassie get spooky for chapter ten ofÂ Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, "Halloween."

Harry and company continue their magical educations in this chapter when they learn the levitation charm Wingardium Leviosa (which also serves as our Spell of the Week). Harry and Ron's rocky relationship with Hermione comes to a head on Halloween, and Hermione is left crying in the bathroom and in mortal danger when a troll gets loose in the dungeon.

We make a number of references to outside sources and pop culture, which are listed below:

- [WBUR Radio Interview with J.K. Rowling](http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-connectiontransc2.htm) (Christopher Lyndon; 12 October 1999)

- [Chasing the dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasing_the_dragon), a slang phrase for drug use

- The [Damsel in Distress trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress)

- [Wingardium Leviosa](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Levitation_Charm) on the Harry Potter Wiki

Thanks for listening, and we'll see you again for 1.11, "Quidditch." Have a magical day!
