We're a little late on this one, but we're finishing off* Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* on Podtrificus Totalus this week, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book.

On this episode, we talk about the Power of Love, which Harry uses to save the school (and the wizarding world) from Lord Voldemort. Dumbledore lets slip a few truths, the House Cup is doled out, and our trio returns home for the summer break.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:

Our Spell of the Week for this episode is Incarcerous, which Professor Quirrell uses to bind Harry during their final confrontation.
