It's Monday and I hate this chapter because it's about Quidditch! Other things happen too, which you can hear about on this week's episode of Podtrificus Totalus, the universe's favorite Harry Potter podcast done book by book, chapter by chapter.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:

- *Bridget Jones's Diary* (2001)

- *Avatar: The Last Airbender* S01E14 ["The Fortuneteller"](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/The_Fortuneteller)

- The *Final Fantasy* series

- *Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic* (2003)

Our Spell of the Week this week is Cheering Charms, which Harry and Ron learn in — you won't believe this — Charms class.
