It's time for a slightly late (but no worse for the wear) episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book.

This week's episode covers chapter eight of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, "The Potions Master." Harry and Ron begin their classes at Hogwarts, where Harry butts heads with Professor Snape, who seems to have a mysterious grudge against him. The mystery of the little package from chapter five also develops in this chapter, with the revelation of a break in at Gringotts.

We make a number of references to outside sources and pop culture in this episode, which are listed below:

Our spell of the week for this episode is Scourify, which Snape likely uses to clean up Neville's disastrous first attempt at Potion making. We also respond to tweets from [Jose](https://twitter.com/joseluissolo) and [Justine](https://twitter.com/mixtapemontage) (of the [Cutaways Podcast](http://www.thecutaways.com/)).

Thanks for listening and we’ll see you again for 1.09, “The Midnight Duel!” Have a magical day!
