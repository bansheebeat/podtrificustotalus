We're coming at you a few hours later than usual with a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book. 

In chapter six of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, Ron gets a Howler from Mrs. Weasley and must deal with his broken wand, Harry unwillingly gets a few lessons in fame from Gilderoy Lockhart, and Hermione cleans up the mess of their incompetent Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
