It's time to serve detention and explore the menacing Forbidden Forest on Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter read along podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book.

After foolishly forgetting the Invisibility Cloak, Harry and Hermione are caught in their dragon disappearing act by Filch. McGonagall deducts a kiloton of points from Gryffindor House for their transgressions, and Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Draco serve out their punishments in the Forbidden Forest, where a mysterious evil lurks.
