episodeSubtitle: "And Father won't tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing--last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it's a matter of time before one of them's killed this time... I hope it's Granger."

It's Monday! There's a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus! We are a Harry Potter podcast that reads the books chapter by chapter!

This chapter sees Hermione finally finish brewing the Polyjuice Potion, with relatively positive results. Harry and Ron, disguised as Goyle and Crabbe, infiltrate the Slytherin Common Room, but Malfoy denies any involvement in the attacks, leaving them back at square one of unraveling the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets.
