It's Monday, which always brings a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book, by two people who know a medium amount about Harry Potter.

In this chapter, Harry makes an unintended detour on his way to Diagon Alley, and he spots Draco and Lucius Malfoy visiting some unsavory shops to unload some unsavory goods. Harry is rescued by Hagrid, who reunites him with the Weasleys. All visit Flourish and Blotts and meet the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Gilderoy Lockhart.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:

- [Gildory Lockhart's published works](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart%27s_published_works) on the Harry Potter Wiki (spoiler warning for *Chamber of Secrets*)
