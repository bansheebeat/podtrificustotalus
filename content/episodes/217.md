Itâ€™s Monday and Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book, is here to tell you the good news about baby genius Ginny Weasley.

This week sees Harry attempt to rescue Ginny from her fate in the Chamber. There, he encounters the memory ghost of Tom Riddle, who has been controlling Ginny and forcing her to open the Chamber this whole time. Harry must fight the Basilisk and escape with his friends (plus Professor Lockhart).
