This week's episode of Podtrificus Totalus covers the second Halloween that Harry spends at Hogwarts, and it's even spookier than the last! Nearly Headless Nick asks Harry and his friends to attend his Deathday Party, a celebration of the anniversary of his death. There, the kids get a glimpse into the world of ghosts, but as they leave, Harry once again hears the mysterious voice, and they stumble upon poor petrified Mrs. Norris under a message about the Chamber of Secrets being opened.
