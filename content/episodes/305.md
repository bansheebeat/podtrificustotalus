It's Monday -- you know us, you love us, it's time for Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done book by book, chapter by chapter.

This week we cover chapter five of *Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban*, in which Harry encounters a clumsy metaphor for depression -- I mean, a new and foreboding creature in the magical world! -- meets his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and eats some chocolate.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:

- *Brookyln 99* (TV Series)

- *The Lord of the Rings* series

- The scary *Beowulf* movie from 2007

- *Romeo + Juliet* (1996)

- [JKR's "Idle Jottings,"](https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/other-canon/jkr/jkr-com-scrapbook/jottings1/) preserved by the Harry Potter Lexicon, which reference that the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher in *Prisoner of Azkaban* may have been a woman at some point in the writing process
