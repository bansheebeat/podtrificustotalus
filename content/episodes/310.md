It's Monday and it's time to relive childhood trauma with Podtrificus Totalus, the only Harry Potter read along podcast that spends several minutes talking about Pooh Bear hats!

This chapter of *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* is one big exposition dump! Harry chats with Lupin about the effect the Dementors have on him, and Lupin agrees to teach Harry how to defend himself against them. Fred and George gift Harry the Marauder's Map which (among other things) shows him the secret passages between Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. Finally, Harry overhears a conversation in the Three Broomsticks which finally reveals the connection between him and Sirius Black.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:
