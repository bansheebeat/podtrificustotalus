It's Monday and Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, is remaining true to their word to release episodes regularly! What a dream! What a treat for you!

This week's chapter sees the trio falling complacent, reluctant to ask Hagrid any questions about his expulsion. But when Harry's room is ransacked, Tom Riddle's diary stolen, and Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron set out to find answers but are interrupted by the appearance of Cornelius Fudge and Lucius Malfoy.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:
