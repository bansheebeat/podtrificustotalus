It's Monday and that means a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, the universe's favorite Harry Potter podcast!

In this week's chapter, Harry finds a mystery diary that belonged to a T.M. Riddle fifty years ago -- the same amount of time that has passed since the Chamber of Secrets was last opened. A Valentine's Day disaster ends up revealing the diary's secrets, and Harry learns who opened the Chamber last time.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:

Our Spell of the Week is Aparecium, which Hermione uses on the diary in attempt to reveal its secrets.
