It's Monday, and that means a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book. 

We've finally reached the big one: with the help of Ron and his brothers, Harry visits the Burrow for the first time and spends time with (objectively) the best character in the Harry Potter universe, Molly Weasley. There are also gnomes.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:
