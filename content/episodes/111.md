This week on Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book, Cassie and Joe get physical for chapter eleven of Harry Potter and the Philsopher's Stone, "Quidditch."

A November chill has hit Hogwarts in this chapter, requiring Hagrid to, for some reason, defrost the school broomsticks while Harry frets over his first Quidditch match as the Gryffindor Seeker. Harry learns the cause of Snape's apparent limp, then a curse mysteriously befalls his broomstick during the game.
