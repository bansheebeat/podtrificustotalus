Mysteries are solved and soundboards are abused this week on Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione at last discover who Nicolas Flamel is and Cassie relives childhood fears.

After giving a bullied Neville a Chocolate Frog card, Harry remembers where he first heard Nicolas Flamel's name. Hermione pulls out a giant book and the trio finally uncovers what Fluffy is guarding. Snape referees Gryffindor's Quidditch match, and Harry overhears a foreboding conversation.
