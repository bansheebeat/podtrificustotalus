It's Monday, and that means it's time for another episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book.

In this chapter, Harry continues to spend a painful summer with the Dursleys, with the notable inclusion of Vernon's sister Marge. Harry struggles to maintain his cool as Marge berates him, with explosive results.
