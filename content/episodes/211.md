It's Monday and that means yet another episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book. We continue our coverage of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* with mounting rumors about Harry's connections to the attacks on students. Snape and Lockheart host a disastrous Dueling Club that does little to improve Harry's reputation or the students' preparedness, and two more denizens of Hogwarts are petrified by the end of the chapter.

We make a number of references to outside sources and popular culture, which are listed below:

- *The Last Days of Summer* by Steve Kluger

- *The Princess Diaries* series by Meg Cabot

- [Filius Flitwick](https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/filius-flitwick/) on the Harry Potter Lexicon

- *Gilmore Girls* and *The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel*, created by Amy Sherman-Palladino

- [Hannah Abbott](https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/abbott-family/hannah-abbott/) on the Harry Potter Lexicon

Our Spell of the Week is Expelliarmus, which the students learn at the Dueling Club and which will probably return many more times throughout this podcast.
