It's Monday, and that means it's time to talk about yet another instance of J.K. Rowling doing the worst job she possibly can at representing diverse peoples!

In this chapter of *Prisoner of Azkaban*, Gryffindor plays Ravenclaw in Quidditch, and Harry finally gets to put the Firebolt to work. Harry and Ron consider forgiving Hermione, but a bloody mess on Ron's sheets only serves to distance them further. Harry manages to conjure a Patronus successfully, and Ron faces yet another threat while within the common room...
