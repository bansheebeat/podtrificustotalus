Today we're Apparating in with the fourth episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book.

This week we tackle chapter four of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, "The Keeper of the Keys." Hagrid arrives to rescue Harry from the evil Dursleys and tells him the truth about his past, his parents, and Lord Voldemort in one of the most forward-moving yet mysterious chapters thus far. As we move through the chapters, we grow ever closer to Harry's arrival at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and deeper in J.K. Rowling's magical world. We also introduce a new segment on this episode, Spell of the Week, and answer more listener emails.

We make a number of references to outside sources and pop culture in this episode, which are listed below:
