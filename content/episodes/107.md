We're back after a short break for a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book!

This week's episode covers chapter seven of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, "The Sorting Hat." Harry and his fellow first-years at last arrive at Hogwarts and face the titular Sorting Hat, who places them into the four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.
