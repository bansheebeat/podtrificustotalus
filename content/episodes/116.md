It's Monday, and that means it's time for a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione take their final exams, but Harry is bothered by his scar burning and warning him of approaching danger. They learn that Dumbledore has been summoned away from Hogwarts and realize it is up to them to protect the Philosopher's Stone from Snape and Voldemort.
