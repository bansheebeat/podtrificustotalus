This week on Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book, Cassie and Joe get sad during chapter twelve of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, "The Mirror of Erised."

With the Christmas holidays upon Hogwarts, Harry and the Weasleys are left mostly alone to enjoy snowball fights and lavish Christmas dinners, but a mysterious gift enables Harry to explore the castle unseen at night. He discovers the Mirror of Erised, a magical device that shows the viewer their deepest desire. Harry is entranced by the mirror, but at what cost?
