Podtrificus Totalus is here with a brand new, fashionably late episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book.

This week we cover chapter five of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, "Diagon Alley." In this chapter we at last enter the magical Wizarding World as we follow Harry and Hagrid into Gringotts, the wizard bank, and shops for textbooks, golden cauldrons, robes, an owl, and a wand. Rowling continues to build on the close relationship between Harry and Hagrid in an ultimately eventful and heartwarming chapter.

We make a number of references to outside sources and pop culture in this episode, which are listed below:
