<p>It&rsquo;s time for a brand new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a <em>Harry Potter</em> podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book.</p>
<p>This week we tackle chapter three of <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone</em>, &ldquo;The Letters From No One.&rdquo; Harry receives a mysterious letter in the mail which his aunt and uncle seem determined to prevent him from reading. Not too much else happens in this chapter, besides Uncle Vernon losing his marbles, which always proves entertaining, and Dudley&rsquo;s consistently horrifying behavior. With a cliffhanger ending of a loud knock on the door, we grow closer and closer to the magical world of Hogwarts! We also answer our first listener email from our friend PK from India and discuss the possibility of featuring guests in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, and we&rsquo;ll see you again for 1.04, &ldquo;The Keeper of the Keys!&rdquo; Have a magical day!</p>
