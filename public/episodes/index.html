<p>It&rsquo;s Monday, and that means it&rsquo;s time to talk about yet another instance of J.K. Rowling doing the worst job she possibly can at representing diverse peoples!</p>
<p>In this chapter of <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>, Gryffindor plays Ravenclaw in Quidditch, and Harry finally gets to put the Firebolt to work. Harry and Ron consider forgiving Hermione, but a bloody mess on Ron&rsquo;s sheets only serves to distance them further. Harry manages to conjure a Patronus successfully, and Ron faces yet another threat while within the common room&hellip;</p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Monday, and we&rsquo;re back after a week off with an extra-long episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done book by book, chapter by chapter.</p>
<p>On this week&rsquo;s episode, we cover chapter twelve of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, &ldquo;The Patronus!&rdquo; In this chapter, Harry begins his anti-Dementor lessons with Professor Lupin, but he hesitates when he realizes that blocking out the Dementors might block him out from ever hearing his parents&rsquo; voices again. Harry and Ron&rsquo;s feud with Hermione over the Firebolt continues, and just when they&rsquo;re about to make up, Ron finds a crime scene in his bedsheets with no sign of Scabbers.</p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Monday, and we&rsquo;re flying in on a speedy (but possibly jinxed?) broomstick with the latest episode of Podtrificus Totalus, the international standard in Harry Potter podcasts done chapter by chapter, book by book!</p>
<p>Harry, upset and enraged by the news of Sirius Black&rsquo;s betrayal, is determined to seek revenge for his parents&rsquo; deaths and take the adults in his life to task for withholding the truth from him. Despite Ron and Hermione&rsquo;s attempts to talk him down, Harry continues to seethe until he is distracted by Buckbeak&rsquo;s impending doom. On Christmas day, Harry receives a mysterious and expensive gift with no note or card, prompting a disagreement with Hermione.</p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Monday and it&rsquo;s time to relive childhood trauma with Podtrificus Totalus, the only Harry Potter read along podcast that spends several minutes talking about Pooh Bear hats!</p>
<p>This chapter of <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> is one big exposition dump! Harry chats with Lupin about the effect the Dementors have on him, and Lupin agrees to teach Harry how to defend himself against them. Fred and George gift Harry the Marauder&rsquo;s Map which (among other things) shows him the secret passages between Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. Finally, Harry overhears a conversation in the Three Broomsticks which finally reveals the connection between him and Sirius Black.</p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Monday, which means a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, Cedric Diggory&rsquo;s favorite Harry Potter re-read podcast!</p>
<p>Picking up after Sirius Black attempted to break into the Gryffindor common room, the students are moved into the Great Hall for the night, where Harry overhears an interesting conversation. The next day, Lupin is out sick and Snape subs in for him, abusing students along the way. Gryffindor and Hufflepuff face off in a Quidditch match with disastrous results, and a beloved companion leaves us forever.</p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Monday and we&rsquo;re back at it again at Podtrificus Totalus, the only Harry Potter podcast that spends roughly half the runtime debating the pedagogical methods at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!</p>
<p>This chapter takes <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em> into Hogwarts and keeps Harry out of the Halloween trip to Hogsmeade. As he mopes about the castle, he ends up in Professor Lupin&rsquo;s office for tea and a conversation about fear. While Lupin believes Harry wise for fearing the Dementors most of all, the end of the chapter should perhaps heighten Harry&rsquo;s fear about Sirius Black, who attacks the portrait of the Fat Lady that guards Gryffindor Common Room&hellip;</p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Monday, which always brings a new episode of Podtrificus Totalus, a Harry Potter podcast done chapter by chapter, book by book, by two people who know a medium amount about Harry Potter.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Harry makes an unintended detour on his way to Diagon Alley, and he spots Draco and Lucius Malfoy visiting some unsavory shops to unload some unsavory goods. Harry is rescued by Hagrid, who reunites him with the Weasleys. All visit Flourish and Blotts and meet the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Gilderoy Lockhart.</p></p>
