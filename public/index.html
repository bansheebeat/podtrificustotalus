        <p>Podtrificus Totalus was a <i>Harry Potter</i> read along podcast done one chapter at a time. So long as J.K. Rowling financially benefits from the series, we are no longer comfortable promoting it or engaging in discourse — even critical and analytical discourse — around it. Support of the series funds Rowling's hate campaigns, which have real and deadly ramifications, particularly for trans people. </p>
        <p>This website is an archive of the episodes we have completed; love and effort went into them, and we thank our listeners for supporting the show while it ran. If you'd like to keep up with Cassie, <a href="https://esotericbullshit.net/">you can read her blog</a>. Joe does not maintain a public-facing web presence, but sometimes Cassie mentions him on her blog.</p>
